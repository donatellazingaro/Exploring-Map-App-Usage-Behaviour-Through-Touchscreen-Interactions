## Repository Overview

This repository contains pre-processed data used for clustering analyses, focusing on touchscreen interactions with map applications. These datasets have been aggregated into 200 bins to facilitate detailed clustering and behavioral analysis.

### Files Included:
1. **`Aggregated_all_200bins.csv`**
   - Contains taps data from both map and travel apps, aggregated into 200 bins.
   - Used for clustering analyses to understand combined usage patterns.

2. **`CLustering_Data_bin200_map.csv`**
   - Contains taps data specifically from map apps, aggregated into 200 bins.
   - Used for clustering analyses to explore map-specific usage behaviors.

3. **`CLustering_Data_bin200_travel.csv`**
   - Contains taps data specifically from travel apps, aggregated into 200 bins.
   - Used for clustering analyses to explore travel-specific usage behaviors.
